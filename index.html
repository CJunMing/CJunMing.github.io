									<h3>My Journey</h3>
									<p>When I was young, I loved video game and spent most of my childhood playing gameboy, PSP and PC. As I grew older, I asked myself 'How games are made into a CD or installed into the computer?'. When I started learning about coding during my ITE, it became a goal for my target as a job, hobby and interest.</p>

								<h4>Summary</h4>
								<p>Luma is a 3D third-person adventure puzzle game that emphasizes its story and narrative to create immersive gameplay. It follows Coal, the successor of the Sun, and Luma, the spirit of light, have to find a way to retore the light of the world that is plunge into darkness by Fenrir.</p>
								<h4>Job : Camera and Audio Champion</h4>
								<p>My work in this project mainly consists of managing the audio system and camera system of the engine. I manage audio systems such as fine-toning the editor to make proper adjustments to my college 's needed such as being able to change swap audio, easy-to-access function call, and fixing. While in the camera system, I had the honor of making the camera blending movement and control for shaking the camera in the engine.</p>
								<p>During my time in the group, I learned how to read my college needs and apply them to the engine by listening to their statement and problem. One example was when my college wanted to play multiple sounds from the script, but my audio component only stored one sound at any time. I re-adjusted my audio components to stored multiple sound and changed the call function to allow specific sounds to be called in a single components.</p>

								<h4>Summary</h4>
								<p>Boominâ€™ Kitchen is a 2D platform puzzle adventure game where the player plays as the cook who collects ingredients and containers to learn new recipes from an unknown book. The cook believes he can gain riches if he learns and masters the recipes and sets out on his quest to search for these ingredients.</p>
								<h4>Job : Tech Lead</h4>
								<p>My original main job was handling the editor part of the engine and was changed to a tech lead. My task includes working on the editor and other systems like animation, physics, and scripting logic.</p>
								<p>One thing that I learned from this project was the importance of splitting work for management instead of even work distribution. The reason for dividing work was to allow the programmer to work on a specific problem so that when it was complete, it allowed another programmer to take over and continue the job if the original programmer had an external issues. My colleagues during this project may face problems such as family-related issues or do not know how to do them. I took the initiative to help them as much as I could to reduce their workload.</p>
